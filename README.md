# esx_doorlock_mhacking


All credit goes to @zr0iq(mhacking) and @Hawaii_Beach(esx_doorlock)

Huge thanks to @RagingNaClholic with Fresh Start RP for all of his help.

**Requires 'mhacking' and 'esx'.**

This resource allows one to hack all locked doors within esx_doorlock. 

The hacking will not begin until the player has the item 'keycard' on them. I have included the sql for the item.

The item is consumed once you begin hacking. To change that go to *server\server.lua line 55* and remove it.
